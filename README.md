## üöÄ Get Started

### Clone and Run with Expo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/djsablab/rn-hotel
cd rn-hotel
npm install
npx expo start
```

---

## üî• Firebase Setup

To connect the app to Firebase:

- Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
- Once the project is created, click **Add App +** and select the **Web** platform (</>).
- Name your app (nickname is sufficient).
- Copy **only** the `firebaseConfig` object from the Firebase setup screen and paste it inside the `firebaseConfig.js` file like this:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: "",
  appId: "",
  measurementId: ""
};
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** paste the entire Firebase SDK script-only the `firebaseConfig` object. Including the full script will break the app.

## üóÉÔ∏è Firestore Database Structure

Navigate to **Firestore Database** under your Firebase project and set up the following collections and documents:

### 1. Hotels Collection

Create a collection named `hotels`. Inside it, create a document with any ID and the following fields:

| Field        | Type     | Description                |
|--------------|----------|----------------------------|
| `name`       | `string` | Hotel name                 |
| `location`   | `string` | Hotel location             |
| `description`| `string` | Hotel description          |
| `imageUrl`   | `string` | URL to hotel image         |

### 2. Rooms Subcollection

Under each hotel document, add a **subcollection** named `rooms`. Then, add one or more room documents with these fields:

| Field        | Type      | Description                  |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| `name`       | `string`  | Room name                    |
| `capacity`   | `number`  | Room capacity                |
| `price`      | `number`  | Room price                   |
| `available`  | `boolean` | Availability status of room  |

### 3. Bookings Collection

This collection stores all booking data. Firebase will automatically create it when users make bookings via the app. Each document includes:

| Field        | Type        | Description                          |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `bookedAt`   | `timestamp` | Booking date                         |
| `hotelId`    | `string`    | Associated hotel ID                  |
| `hotelName`  | `string`    | Name of the booked hotel             |
| `price`      | `number`    | Total booking price                  |
| `roomId`     | `string`    | ID of the booked room                |
| `roomName`   | `string`    | Name of the booked room              |
| `userId`     | `string`    | User ID (to track individual users)  |
